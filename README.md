# Minecraft Classroom

This is an open-source implementation of a virtual classroom using Minecraft and Discord.

The reason behind its creation, the initiative and mission of this project is to:

 - Provide remote learners in today's challenging online climate the familiarity of a classroom setting, to be amongst fellow pupils and feel the presence of a teacher in a more physical way than voice-only classrooms allow
 - Repair some of the alienation and isolation felt by students in the wake of learning-from-home

This project is welcoming any and all contributions to its development and capabilities.

# The wiki

This repository is hosted on GitHub, and uses GitHub's Wiki feature to allow public contribution and collaboration towards
